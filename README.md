# Isomorphism

Prove that if two graphs $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic they do *not* have to
be completely connected. I have started with the formal definition of
isomorphism below. Add your answer to this markdown file. [This
page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions)
might help with the notation for mathematical expressions.

$G_1=(V_1 , E_1)$ is isomorphic to $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ if there exists a
one-to-one and onto function (bijection) $f: V_1 \rightarrow V_2$ such that $(u,v)
\in E_1$ iff $(f(u),f(v)) \in E_2$.

**Answer**:  
An easy example of two graphs that are isomorphic and not completely connected would  
be a case where each of the graphs has two nodes, neither of which is connected by  
any edges. If this is the case, then these graphs are, indeed, isomorphic because there  
exists a function that is one-to-one and onto that maps A to B. As a result, we can say  
that two graphs do not need to be completely connected in order to be isomorphic.  
(Please note that if *anything* is wrong with my reasoning or if I was too vague at some  
point, please don't hesitate to let me know what I did wrong and I will fix it right away.  
Thank you).
